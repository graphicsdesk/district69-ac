  As the race to represent District 69 in the New York State Assembly heats up, Columbia alumna Stephanie Ruskay has scored a sizable financial lead over opponent Eli Northrup.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  According to campaign finance disclosures, Ruskay received $130,100 in campaign contributions—almost $40,000 more than Northrup’s $92,755. However, Northrup has netted more individual donors than Ruskay, with a majority of his contributions totaling under $100.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ruskay, a graduate of the School of General Studies and the Jewish Theological Seminary, hopes to be the first female rabbi and female assembly member for District 69 in 50 years. Northrup, who first ran for the seat in 2024, is a public defender who works with Bronx Defenders. Backed by the Working Families Party, a popular progressive political group, Northrup is running on a left-leaning platform that centers policies related to racial and social justice.

  Northrup received donations from 518 people, while Ruskay received funds from 437 people.

  “What I’ve learned in the first campaign and in general is that you need the money to pay good people to do the work to get your name out there, and to be able to canvas, and to be able to organize volunteers,” Northrup said in an interview with Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While Northrup is proud of the donations, he added that monetary gains are not the only factor determining political elections.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Money can’t win you a race,” he said. “It’s energy, it’s integrity, it’s your politics and your ability to connect with people, ultimately, that is most important in building a movement.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Ruskay emphasized the importance of campaign funding. Ruskay wrote in a statement to Spectator that she is “so proud that grassroots donations from neighbors across the Upper West Side and Morningside Heights are fueling my campaign to fight for progressive values.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As a participant in New York state’s matching funds program, she noted that individual contributions allowed her campaign to unlock the maximum amount of public matching funds, which are the majority of her fundraising.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Looking ahead, Ruskay added that she is excited to “continue building a broad coalition who wants an Assembly member who delivers results on housing and affordability, while standing up against ICE and MAGA extremism that threatens the values shared by New Yorkers.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Northrup has been endorsed by Assembly member Amanda Septimo, Assembly member Latrice Walker, and more. Ruskay has been endorsed by District 7 City Council member Shaun Abreu, CC ’14, and former Democratic New York City mayoral nominee Ruth Messinger.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Both candidates accept donations on their websites as they prepare for the upcoming Democratic primary, which will take place June 23.
